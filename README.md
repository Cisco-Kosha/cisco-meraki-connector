What's New in v1
```
The Dashboard API has evolved significantly, providing hundreds of endpoints to manage your Meraki networks!
We want to do so much more. But in order for us to include many of these new features or improvements, we need to break a few things.
The focus of this major version is on Simplicity and Scale, by providing an enjoyable developer experience
The API documentation, Postman collection, and Python library will remain synced and up-to-date with improved navigation and features.
In addition, several improvements and new endpoints have been included with this major release.
```
API Documentation
```
The API Endpoint documentation and complimenting Postman Collection have a new folder structure for navigating the API.
```

Categories
```
The services are grouped into categories, providing a collection of endpoints that behave in a similar way.
CONFIGURE endpoints are for managing cloud configurations
MONITOR endpoints will return status and history informaion
LIVE TOOL endpoints will directly interact with the device
